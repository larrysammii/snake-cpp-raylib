# Classic Snake Game

Written in C++ using the Raylib library.
My first time using C++ and Raylib also my first time making a game.
To be honest most of the codes are a bit shit and I didn't bother to write it nicely since I'm just learning what I can do and what not with C++ and OOP.
Pretty fun though.
